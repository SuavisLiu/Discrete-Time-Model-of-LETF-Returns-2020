# LETF-Returns-2020

## Introduction

Last year (2020) was an extremely tough year for the market worldwide. The Chicago Board Options Exchange’s CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which based on S&P 500 options reached the highest point for the past five year. The average of VIX was extremely high in the history. The other notable peak was in 2008 during the financial crisis which Avellaneda and Zhang’s paper was produced soon after. We can observe some similar behaviors of the leveraged ETFs, such as the under performances of the leveraged ETFs. In this study, we will use the discrete time model in the original paper to produce the returns of 20 double-long and double-short leveraged ETFs from 2020 - 2021. Moreover, the estimation of instantaneous variance in the discrete time model cannot be evaluated in the continuous manner. However, we can reduce the range for the evaluation of the variance to produce a more accurate output for the returns.

The original model can be found here.
